Somethings went on. I want this, I want that, I want these, I want those... But I've never made a <strong>\"GO\"</strong>.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just standing still for all day long, waiting for a vague thing - <strong>a change in my mind</strong>, yeah maybe. Procrastination, you may call, but it's just another florid name - like \"Quarter-life crisis\", \"Feeling lost\", ... and so on.

Did ya just say \"fail\" ??? Oh come off it, ya don't even have the right to call it \"fail\". Cauz' ya know what ? You've nevah given such a fucking <strong>TRY</strong>.

Done ! <span style=\"font-size: 19px; background-color: initial;\">No fail or success here, dude.]</span></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[...OK, my bad, all mine. At least I know how bad I am. I know that I was wrong, and I admit it. No more hiding. Does it help ?]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[No dude. Very sorry to say so. Such a faithful confession, but just \"know\" won't give a shit. Eh, I rememer that you don't know such a fucking thing, do you ?]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[... OK, and then, what will ? What should I do ?]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Why don't you ask yourself ?]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[I did, but...]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Nah-ah, <strong>\"but\"</strong>, <strong>\"but\"</strong> and <strong>\"but\"</strong>.

OK, look. I did have a plan. I make ones on Excel with colorful cells, tables and sheets, a \"master project\" for myself to be better. I tried to put my-fucking-self in discipline and rules. But every time, the <strong>\"motivation\"</strong> is gone within a week. I just don't know why ?]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[And, anything else ?]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[Yeah, of course. I did <strong>think</strong>, alot and very serious. Uhm, kind of \"meditation\", I could say. Thinking about my career, about what I would become in the next few years, about my \"life goals\". I also tried to find out my \"passion\", to define my \"purpose of life\"... Yep, I did think alot. But they're all stucked. Just questions without any answers...]</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">[And, have you done anything to materialised them, besides of thinking and planning ?
