Still, i am a bad navigator with a big yet fragile heart. Despite endless rejection and adbomination, there is no stopping me rushing toward the Isle of Seduction.</div><div>If you pour a handful of salt into a cup of water, the water becomes undrinkable. But if you pour the salt into a river, people can continue to draw the water to cook, wash, and drink. The river is immense, and it has the capacity to receive, embrace, and transform.</div><div>When our hearts are small, our understanding and compassion are limited, and we suffer. We can’t accept or tolerate others and their shortcomings, and we demand that they change. But when our hearts expand, these same things don’t make us suffer anymore. We have a lot of understanding and compassion and can embrace others. We accept others as they are, and then they have a chance to transform.</div><div>Then,</div><div>I fooled myself into the abuse of online dating app.</div><div>Then,</div><div>Quẹt phải.</div><div>Then,</div><div>Quẹt phải.</div><div>Then,</div><div>Quẹt phải.</div><div>Then,</div><div>Galileo Figaro.</div><div>Small talk, chitchat, trash talk are all it takes to engage a conversation. Music does build the bridge, though. We formed a dynamic interaction, i presume. Still, what if it's just some kind of vague infatuation?</div><div>Sometimes we feel empty, we feel a vacuum, a great lack of something. We don’t know the cause, it’s very vague, but that feeling of being empty inside is very strong. We expect and hope for something much better so we’ll feel less alone, less empty. The desire to understand ourselves and to understand life is a deep thirst. There’s also the deep thirst to be loved and to love.</div><div>We are ready to love and be loved. It’s very natural. But because we feel empty, we try to find an object of our love. Sometimes we haven’t had the time to understand ourselves, yet we’ve already found the object of our love.</div><div>When we realize that all our hopes and expectations of course can’t be fulfilled by that person, we continue to feel empty. You want to find something, but you don’t know what to search for. In everyone there’s a continuous desire and expectation; deep inside, you still expect something better to happen.</div><div>But,</div><div>You burned my emtions like a raging fire.</div><div>Every moments we spent feels like eternity, every roads we took is fuled with compassion. Or that is what my illusions took place.</div><div>Wise man said:\"Only fools rush in!\". Then, Being a fool is my ultimate expertise.
