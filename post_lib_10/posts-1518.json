Being an overseas student/ foreigner in a non-English speaking country makes finding an internship/ job more difficult due to l</em><a href=\"https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/im_broken_depressed_foreigners_struggle_to_find_work_in_finland/10641139\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>anguage barrier</em></a><em>. This is not the ultimate recipe to getting what you want, but hopefully will give you a broader and different perspective when it comes to applying for a job. Good luck!</em>&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finding an internship is pretty much about being at the right place at the right time. Being at the right place equals you can prove yourself capable of the job requirement and at the right time means there’s an opportunity in front of you.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is why to some people finding an internship feels like it’s either pure luck or it’s because of one’s outstanding capabilities. That’s not true and you can totally make a winning plan to get yourself an internship.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>1. Timing</strong></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finding an internship is hard and confusing partly because it’s a process rather than a one-time effort that you send your application and you get the offer immediately. It really depends on each company, but usually the recruitment is gonna start a month or two before the working period starts. What happened to me in my first summer in college is that I tried to apply for a job late in March when most of the application deadlines have already expired.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Therefore, your main task in this stage would be to find out when the internship recruitment season starts. This could depend on:&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">a/ the country you are living in</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">b/ the sector you want to work in</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">c/ the specific company</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">You can find this out by doing a simple Google research, talk to your university careers department or check the previous recruitment dates.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><u>Tip</u></strong>: Always on the lookout by checking careers portal, recruitment website every week. This way you will keep up with new openings and have plenty of time to prepare your application.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>2. Hunting, tracking and managing like a pro</strong></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now is the crucial part of the job hunting game: Where do you find internship?</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">These are the main channels widely used in Europe:</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn&nbsp;</a></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- <a href=\"https://www.indeed.fi/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Indeed&nbsp;</a></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Glassdoor&nbsp;</a></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- University careers portal&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- And other sites: <a href=\"https://y-makers.fi/en/\" target=\"_blank\">https://y-makers.fi/en/</a>&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">It might be a different case for Asian countries. The most common recruitment channels I came across, for example in Vietnam is through word-of-mouth and Facebook group & page. Best way to find is to follow industry leaders and keep your ears open. As for the marketing & advertising industry in Vietnam, I follow:</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Mr <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/haithanhhcmpt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Phan Hai</a></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Mr <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/buiquangtinhtu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bui Quang Tinh Tu</a> (he also has a fantastic website on digital marketing, you should check it out: <a href=\"https://conversion.vn/\" target=\"_blank\">https://conversion.vn/</a> )</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Hong Kong-based: <a href=\"http://www.internshipasia.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Internship Asia</a> (I actually found my internship in Hong Kong through this website)</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advertising.debating/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advertising Debate</a>&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/uanvn/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Underground Agency of Network&nbsp;</a></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- <a href=\"http:// https://ybox.vn/tuyen-dung\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ybox</a> VN (never had a contact by using this but also an option)</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong><u>Tip</u></strong>: Don’t be afraid to in introduce yourself (your background and career interests) in a group. It’s okay if things do not turn out the way you want. Just take this as a learning process about the industry and the employer. Open yourself to discussion / coffee meeting or quick phone call. If you are feeling anxious, just remind yourself that they can only say no – and it’ll be the same as you don’t ask.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">The next step I would do is to create a Google spreadsheet / excel sheet to track all of the information about the positions I’d like to apply to. So basically, it should have these tabs:&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Company,&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Job Description,&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Deadline,&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Link to application/ Email contact,&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Status (application sent/ invited to interview/ rejected)&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- Note</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Does not have to be anything magnificent, mine looks like this.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/img.spiderum.com/sp-images/b61a0410537811e9bb05fb5958dff4b5.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"><figcaption class=\"image-description\" contenteditable=\"false\" placeholder=\"Chú thích ảnh (không bắt buộc)\"><br></figcaption></figure></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Why</strong><strong>?</strong></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- You won’t forget the deadline&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- You can estimate when you should start preparing for the application</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- It’s easier to tailor your resume with personal notes</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- You can prioritize according to urgency (deadline) or personal preference</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">- You’ll learn from the rejections and improve your chances of getting hired</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Like I have said, job hunting is a process where two parties trying to get to know more about each other and convince the other of their capability and potential for a long-term relationship. Chances are that you are not going to find the perfect position for you right at your first shot (even though that does happen). As a result, the best strategy is to apply to as many suitable positions as you can and having a Google sheet helps you to organize and keep track of this.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now that you have gathered a list of job openings, the next step is to study the company, the position carefully in order to understand what the ideal candidate looks like, and tailor your resume to it.</div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.todayvylearns.com/my-blog/how-to-prepare-your-internship-application\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read Part 2 - How to Prepare for the Online Application Round</a></div><div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.todayvylearns.com/my-blog/nailing-your-job-interview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read Part 3 - How to Prepare for the Interview Round</a></div>","cat_id":{"_id":11,"name":"Kỹ năng"},"creator_id":14738,"created_at":"2019-03-31T05:58:06.099Z"}
