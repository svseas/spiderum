{"_id":3958,"body":"<p>You know Life is tough. Whatever you do , whenever you go , whoever you meet. What&#39;s the point of all that?</p><p>I don&#39;t know what are you thinking right now but I believe part of your journey is about finding yourself.</p><p>Some people losing themselves along the way.Some after quite a long time , they realise by their own, what do they really want, somehow they can manage to go back to the true purpose why they started doing it in the first place.</p><p>However, some are not. How come?</p><p>Truth be told , I don&#39;t know. Sounds irony, hah?</p><p>But it is the truth.That&#39;s why I&#39;m so confused from time to time.I will tell you this even it sounds kinda childish and stupid for some extent.</p><p>I first thought about this sometimes when I was reading Death Note ( one of the most well-known &nbsp;Japanese mangas and animes). The main evil character named Light &nbsp;picked up the Death Note of one Shinigami( literally means \"Death- God\") was bored to death in hell and wanted to have some fun so he dropped it in the human world.Whoever &nbsp;has that book have the power to force someone to death by some rules ( you can read the Death Note wiki to know more specific information).</p><p>The main problem here is in the very first beginning, Light attempted to use Death Note was good. He determined to use it to eliminate all the evils and bring peace into the world of a living. It was a good motivation in the first start.Then, when he discovered the way to use the Death Note properly , how it works , he began his punishment to who he thinks deserve to die because of that people wrongdoing.<br>I myself have to admit that in the very first start I thought he was a hero , a good guy , he even so smart and intelligent he started to punish many criminals to death.First, I totally agree with that kind of action , bring justice to this chaotic world. But then when the police find out many prisoners die.The cause of death is very strange and unexplainable.They decide to chase down who did this to their prisoners.<br>At that time , I wondered why they have to chase Light down? Actually, they should&#39;ve praised for what he did.But then I realise what&#39;s the point of government&#39;s regulations and laws to protect people? What&#39;s the point of the a person sentenced to life imprisonment and a person sentenced to death-penalty.What&#39;s the difference if all the criminals all have to die immediately?<br>Because in some cases, people deserve a second chance.<br>And one thing after another, when the FBI stepped in , and when they almost found out who Kira is ( Kira in fact is Light&#39;s nickname, he named it himself and some people admire Kira for what he has done and also if I remember exactly Kira means God ).<br>And Can you imagine what would he do next to make him the evil one? Yes.He killed 12 FBI agents who went after him.12 people, in my opinion , who do whatever it takes to capture criminals and bad guys.Why they have to die? Just because they almost figure out who is the real Kira.And now I think you think the same thing as I am. What&#39;s about the very first reason he started doing all such things? Bring justice to this world, exterminate all the evils ever existence.<br>Are these 12 agents evil? Are they criminals? Are they guilty? No.They die because they were doing the right thing.<br>I can&#39;t believe this is real because as far as I know , some bad guys don&#39;t afraid of showing the world that&#39;s what they do even it&#39;s really a terrible thing.But this guy, Light they kill them just because he so scared that they finally put down the curtain , reveal the true identity of Kira.<br>I don&#39;t understand, no one force him to do that. Why he so scared everyone will know who he really is?<br>After that , he still doing all the horrible things. He didn&#39;t even think for a second maybe he should stop. Now I know he finally losing himself , he&#39;s losing the true goal when he first started doing all those things. He&#39;s chasing after power , he wants to gain the powerful power that no one in the world of a living has.<br>In the end , all the fightings , killings ,... are all about preventing people from recognize the true identity of Kira is actually Light. That is an action of a coward. He has guts to do things but don&#39;t have the courage to take all the responsibilities!!! He wants to control the death but he is also the one scare of the death most.<br>Such an Coward!<br><br>From that moment on, all the fight and killing and death, it&#39;s all about between L and Japanese police officers &nbsp;include Light&#39;s father - he&#39;s a chief officer.Sounds kinda sarcastic when his own son is the killer.I told you , life is so irony.<br><br>I almost forgot L is a famous FBI agent , he never show up his face but even the hardest cases , he can be able to manage to solve it.And this case isn&#39;t an exception.It&#39;s just , I&#39;m sorry if I spoil it even you guys haven&#39;t watch it yet.He died even before Light and you know the reason why .Finally , he know who is real Kira is.That&#39;s so sad. But don&#39;t worry , L is so smart that he also made a plan to never let Light get away for what he has done.( I don&#39;t want to spoil another interesting thing before you watch it).It also teaches us that we should always make a plan for the future , maybe two plan A and plan B in case plan A don&#39;t go as we planned. :D<br>Let&#39;s get back to the story.<br>Light after several things he did , even it was all wrong but some people still think what he did is so awesome and Misa is one of them.Because Light killed the one who killed Misa family.She determined if she can find who did that , she will love him and do everything he ask.And that&#39;s what Light do.He didn&#39;t even notice her or like her at all until he found out Misa can do something for him and she even sacrificed half of her lifetime for Shinigami&#39;s eyes for Light.However, sometimes when Misa did some stupid things and won&#39;t obey his order , he was about to kill her but Misa has her own Shinigami and this Shinigami unfortunately , has a feeling for Misa so he wouldn&#39;t let Light kill her.( at the end, this Shinigami die for Misa sake. I can&#39;t believe it even Shinigami has a heart but a human like Light has not).<br>Ok, I know some people think Misa is so silly , put her life on Light hands.It&#39;s not Light fault because she just thrown herself at him. But after Misa, there is one girl that Light even told her that he loved her but was it true? Because when she was captured , she called him and hoped that Light could rescue her but I guess you know what Light did. He killed her without second thought. He just used her for his purpose.<br>I also learn for myself , don&#39;t trust people easily, sometimes they just fool us for their sakes.<br>How could it be possible? He even dare to call himself God of justice.So , where is the justice that he brought? I think all he brought to the world is chaos and death. He even think what he has done is for the best of this world.<br>But after all , what he did was only for himself , for his desire of power, all he ever wanted is power to control life and death, he wanted to be powerful.But who the hell do he think he is to judge people&#39;s lives , who should live and who should die? What&#39;s the point when he claim what he gunna do is for the people in this world to live in peace?<br>I&#39;m not anyone special to told people what should they do? But I think sometimes you shouldn&#39;t tell the world what you do is for another person or the people in this world when all is for your purposes.If you want to do it for yourself ,just say it.Don&#39;t make you become bigger when all you ever wanted is only for little piece in this world is you. But even when you do it for only you , it&#39;s ok because after all deep inside everyone of us, what we do is really for ours.But don&#39;t use other, don&#39;t cheat on people , don&#39;t fool them to make profit for only you. I don&#39;t say that everyone deserve a second chance because there are something that already done can&#39;t never be forgiven. But only you can&#39;t decide someone&#39;s fate.<br>That&#39;s the reason why we have laws, court,.... I don&#39;t say it always true.Nobody&#39;s perfect. But at least, it sees through many eyes , many perspectives to find a right way to decide what to do for people&#39;s actions.<br>I learn alot from Death Note. And there are still many other things I have to learn.<br>I learn about justice, right and wrong, beliefs and many other things. Light is a strong opponent compare to L. It likes Evil is not always easy to defeated. But in the end , The good is always win no matter what happened.<br>I strongly recommend you should watch or read Death Note to find out your own thoughts and lessons.Once it was found, it never left.<br>P/S Sorry if this is too long or too many mistakes. This is the piece I wrote almost 3 years ago on my blog when I was so emotional about Death Note&#39;s final episode. And all of a sudden I wanna share this again. I love Death Note like crazy.</p>","cat_id":{"_id":16,"name":"English Zone"},"created_at":"2016-09-06T08:28:26.291Z","creator_id":2539,"down_point":0,"tags":[],"title":"\"Death Note\" : The right and wrong , The good and the bad","up_point":14}
