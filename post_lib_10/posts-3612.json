I have finished more than 50 books, including several challenges like “The wind-up bird chronicle” – Haruki Murakami or “The trial” – Franz Kafka or “1984” – George Orwell. Yes, I am counting books. But, before judging, let me explain here: it is not for any kind of record at all. I have started my reading diary because of 2 main reasons. First, it helps me to see clearly what is my true interest in life. If you don’t know it yet, your book taste tells much about your personality (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-your-favorite-book-say-about-you_us_57b4a23de4b0b3bb4b089e3f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">see a Huffington post here</a>)<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-does-your-favorite-book-say-about-you_us_57b4a23de4b0b3bb4b089e3f).\" target=\"_blank\">.</a> Second, I combine it with a short review of each book, to the extent of whether should I read it again in the future, or at least which parts of the book that interest me. By doing so, I wish to compare my knowledge after re-reading it again next time, or of the same topic from some other books. Remember the quote: “You cannot step into the same river twice”. Now Andy Luong’s quote: “You cannot have the same experience from reading a book twice”.</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence, in these last days of 2017, after reviewing my reading year, I think it is a good idea to share with you my recommended 3 books of 2017. Hope it can be a sort of motivation for some to start (or keep) the habit of reading in new year, as you may know from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Flow-Psychology-Happiness-Classic-Achieve/dp/0712657592\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Flow” – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a> that reading is one of the most “flow” activities.</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.

Even though the ending might be a bit harsh and definitely not fairy tale style (especially with a boy who cycling 80km to school every day – Lintang), it is still for sure a valuable lesson for everyone (especially for a person who wish to dedicate career to education like me).</div><div><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/img.spiderum.com/sp-images/6f1c9f30e64811e7b6442553736de259.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"><figcaption class=\"image-description\" contenteditable=\"false\" placeholder=\"Chú thích ảnh (không bắt buộc)\"><br></figcaption></figure></div><div><br></div><div>2.

Because of this, and ironically his intelligence, he allows himself to kill who he thinks is the most redundant person in the world – an old usurer without family, and he considers it as the first step on his way to become great. However, the crime has punished him so harshly both psychologically and emotionally (where Dostoyevsky’s talent in describing human emotions has performed beautifully), only because of the reason that he is just a human.</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">P.s: pessimistically happy ending.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3.
