You will never know what kind of battle they’re fighting, what kind of things they have been through unless you’ve been once on their shoes. You realise this is not just YOUniverse anymore. It’s not just about you. Everyone has their own bad and good days and problems to deal with.</p><p>MONACHOPSIS: I always has an *outsider* feeling everywhere I go, even at home. Sometimes I wonder if this feeling is always there and I just never notice, it stays by my side all along and merely waits for a particular moment to pops up.</p><p>VELLICHOR: Who can resist the temptation of an old bookshop? Just the smell makes me feel like I’m in heaven and life is truly spectacular when I have all the time in the world to read all the books there.</p><p>RUBATOSIS: I know now what I didn’t know then, first love is freaking hard to forget.</p><p>MAUERBAUETRAURIGKEIT: Sometimes, all I ever wanted is solitude. I just want this universe is simply just about me, myself and I.</p><p>JOUSKA: Have you ever wondered, what would be like if all the conversations in our head are all real? I mean, it’s not just some hypothetical we play out in our head but with someone real in real life? That will just be so perfect.</p><p>CHRYSALISM: We all need some moments to feel grateful for what we have, to feel we are at ease, to feel we are in peace and to feel we actually belong to this moment, belong here, listening to the rain and thunderstorm</p><p>.ELLIPSISM: You will never know, you just have to live and to be true with yourself until the day it will happen and you will know.</p><p>MOLEDRO: Who doesn’t love a fantasy world in which we feel truly belong to? Who doesn’t want to be at Hogwarts, right?</p><p>LACHESISM: Too see how strong we really are, to test our own limits or simply just wonder who will I become after something like that?</p><p>EXULANSIS: It’s just too complicated to understand and too hard to explain. It’s easier to keep it to yourself and pretend it’s nothing.</p><p>ADRONITIS: Sometimes it’s easy to fall in love with someone or to like someone at first sight but how can it be so difficult and take a lot of time and effort if we want to really know, really understand him/her?</p><p>HIYBBPRQAG: I always want to do or create something creative, something awesome, good and powerful. But then, I wonder is there something like that left out there for me to do?</p><p>ONISM: If we can live a life in parallel worlds all at once. If we can teleport everywhere we want in just a blink of an eye. If we…</p><p>LIBEROSIS: Damn it. If I just simply don’t give a shit. If I can just let it be. Why I have to fucking care about it? WHY?</p><p>ALTSCHMERZ: How am I so ugly? I just want to be pretty for once. How am I so fucking stupid? I just don’t want to let my grandpa down again and again. How am I so sensitive? I’m losing my ex-BF just because of that.</p><p>OCCHIOLISM: After all, I’m just an ordinary girl.</p><p>CATOPTRIC TRISTESSE: You can pretend you don’t give a fuck but deep down, you always want to know what others really think or do they even care but you just can’t so you learn to “don’t give a shit” about that stuff.</p><p>THE BENDS: You overestimate things. Hence, when it truly happens, you lose your interests.You just keep overthinking stuff all the time so then when it actually happened, you forgot to &nbsp;just enjoy it.</p>","cat_id":{"_id":16,"name":"English Zone"},"created_at":"2016-09-08T09:52:20.155Z","creator_id":2539,"down_point":1,"tags":[],"title":"Beautiful Words That Perfectly Describe Emotions You-Could-Never-Explain-Before","up_point":17}
