{"_id":7240,"body":"<p>There were various occasions in my life where I could have gotten myself a girlfriend. All those girls were nice and I was interested in them. Perhaps I unknowingly made them fall in love with me as I didn't really have any intention to do so at first. Still, I rejected them all when they raised the love flag as they all lacked something I was looking for. I knew that it would hurt them even though I didn't want so. Then I wondered, why would I get them involved in the first place?</p><p>As time passes, people change. I wonder if I would feel the same towards those girls. Some feelings are still the same, some are different. I can't even define what is love anymore, I might have lost it somewhere along my life. To me, everything seems just too hazy.</p><p>But I do realize that somehow I miss the \"them\" in the past. I feel like my feelings back then were much clearer. If only I could have given all of them what they wanted from me - <em>love, </em>maybe<em>&nbsp;</em>- even if a little. But I'm bounded by the rule of this world:</p><p>One's love is endless, yet it can only be given to <em>one</em>.</p><p>How cruel.</p>","cat_id":{"_id":16,"name":"English Zone"},"created_at":"2017-03-26T20:51:10.364Z","creator_id":7010,"down_point":0,"tags":[],"title":"A lost love","up_point":18}
