{"_id":16977,"tags":[],"up_point":14,"down_point":0,"title":"Sehnsucht.","body":"<div>There's this feeling suddenly just come and go from time to time that I couldn't quite understand myself no matter how many times I've tried to analyse it. I couldn't even name it properly. The kind of feeling when I wake up on a beautiful Sunday morning and I just don't want to meet anyone even though I am about to meet a dear friend for a coffee at my fav cafe.&nbsp;</div><div>Some days, I complety hate being alone, I constantly look at my phone to see if any of friends are online or the Couchsurfing hangout to find someone to spend time having a cup of coffee with. Some other days, the idea of being with people scares the hell out of me for no reasons at all.</div><div>I've Couchsurfed basically everywhere I go in Germany, Slovenia, France, Austria and Spain since May and each one of them was an uniquely amazing experience as I've been received so much kindness I couldn't exactly describe by words how grateful I am. But sometimes, I do think I will change my original plan to visit a place if I cannot find a host. It is not because I don't want to spend money to stay in a hostel or a airbnb, I think it is more like I am afraid I will not be able find anyone to strike up a conversation the whole trip. At least I can still guarantee I'll have a few quick conversations with my Couchsurfing host now and then even if he/she is busy. On the other hand, since the day I started using Couchsurfing finding hosts function, I become even more spontaneous and more willing to travel alone than before and right now, most of the times, I don't even like the idea of having a travel companion even if that means friends (except if it's my best friend). I love wandering off around to enjoy the city's vibrancy alone, taking all the magnificent sceneries in. I wonder what it is inside that makes me such a confusing person even to myself.</div><div>Today is one of the days the feeling just comes out of the blue when I woke up. Sitting in the living room, procrastinating studying for one midterm next week by watching the last season of Breaking Bad, suddenly I heard people speaking either Catalan or Spanish loudly outside, I felt a strange and inexplicable feeling that I had never felt before. It was the watery rush of homesickness as if an ocean was rising up in my chest. For the first time ever, I feel deeply in my heart that I am, I really am so far away from home.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><em>Sehnsucht&nbsp;</em></strong>- another German word that has no equivalent in English - to describe the inconsolable longing in the human heart for a far, familiar, non-earthly land one can identify as one's home. Now, more than ever, I long to be transported into my home, to sit down quietly and take a cup of coffee at Tranquil, to walk up the path to see my beloved ones, to wrap my arms around them, and to stay there forever and ever.</div><div>Maybe, just maybe I have to leave in order to really miss home, to travel to figure out how truly beloved my starting point was.</div><div><img src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/img.spiderum.com/sp-images/c6a5db40e5c011e8972657cced5e73cf.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></div>","cat_id":{"_id":14,"name":"Chuyện trò - Tâm sự"},"creator_id":2539,"created_at":"2018-11-11T14:58:52.599Z"}
