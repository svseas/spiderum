{"_id":11195,"title":"Thank you, Spiderum","body":"<div>2017 was a year with a lot of dramatic events in my life. Coming across Spiderum was one of such, and fortunately it was a very positive experience for me. Now Spiderum is my #2 most frequently accessed website (#1 is Facebook, of course). It's also a great thing that I made a few friends&nbsp;here as well.</div><div>My long-lost thirst for knowledge, Spiderum helped me find it. I finally felt like I wanted to read and write again after such a long time doing nothing. There's still a lot of room for improvement, however the fisrt step - the hardest step&nbsp;- was over.</div><div>And so, I'd like to thank the founders as well as all of you - members and readers alike - for giving me this wonderful experience. Thank you all for making my journey in 2017 a bit less hopless, a bit less disappointing and a bit less lonely (though I'm still spending these last moments of the year alone, just saying :-<).</div><div>Happy new year, everyone. May Spiderum become an even better place for all of&nbsp;us.</div>","cat_id":{"_id":14,"name":"Chuyện trò - Tâm sự"},"creator_id":7010,"created_at":"2017-12-31T16:03:11.499Z","down_point":0,"up_point":32,"tags":[{"_id":"5908e8265210c2058fbe4716","name":"SPIDERUM"}]}
