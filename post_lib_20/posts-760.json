Because there are moments that make you feel like no one supports what you're doing. No one trusts you, or loves you.&nbsp;</div><div>But then, you will enjoy it. I meant, enjoy being lonely. You created a tiny world where you can't be hurt by anyone and you don't have to try to fake someone that ain't you. It's just about you.&nbsp;</div><div>When the rain comes and everyone hides from it, you're the only one who slowly walks under the rain and definitely enjoys it, even though you would catch a cold after that.&nbsp;</div><div><figure class=\"aligncover\"><img src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/img.spiderum.com/sp-images/470c7e30855b11e99bab632d655284ee.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"><figcaption class=\"image-description\" contenteditable=\"false\" placeholder=\"Chú thích ảnh (không bắt buộc)\">Tôi lạc quan giữa đám đông :D</figcaption></figure></div><div>That world won't annoy you cause every single object in that world exists for yourself and your comfort.</div><div>I'm choked up with this reality. I'm just not one of them. I have tried so much but I couldn't say that \"I belong to that society\". People easily brush off their own mistakes but always chastise others for however trivial they are. I'm sick of it. I cannot live in a world where people would smile friendly at their haters and enemies. What's the matter with straightly telling someone that you can't be friend with them or just ignoring the one you hate? Is it wrong to do these?</div><div>In the end, I soon realized that I do not fit in this world. I was left behind and chose not to catch up with people. I kept staying at home, ran away from drama and gossip because I can't live with them, honestly. I enjoy cooking, listening to music and surfing the Internet.
