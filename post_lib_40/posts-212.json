Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.\"&nbsp;</div><div>(Gary Provost)</div><h3><strong>Bonus</strong></h3><div><br></div><div><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/img.spiderum.com/sp-images/67c49a6015f811e7ae28b9f83783eb34.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"><figcaption class=\"image-description\" contenteditable=\"false\" placeholder=\"Chú thích ảnh (không bắt buộc)\"><br></figcaption></figure></div><div><br></div>","cat_id":{"_id":16,"name":"English Zone"},"created_at":"2017-03-31T10:29:05.968Z","creator_id":5552,"down_point":0,"tags":[{"_id":"582c132c6dc39c3d02dde2cf","name":"truyện ngắn"}],"title":"Collection of creative short stories ","up_point":43}
